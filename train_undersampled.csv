philosophers stone the most powerful transmutational artifact in existence known for changing any object instantly into gold As his opponent bidder and henchman ambush him for the stone he deftly defends it by combining historical knowledge and swordplay throughout the auction house concurrently parrying his opponents blows while the two debate the pricing of the items within Once Flynn has won the duel he proceeds to his hotel lobby hoping to repair his relationship with his girlfriend only to find that she has abandoned him after a string of disappointments Meanwhile in Carpathia

them While he cares nothing for the politics he has spent most of his life searching for the chalice and he sees this as his best chance to secure it Using a handful of scrolls created by French monks Professor Lazlo deduces that there is a marker that partially gives location of the chalice in New Orleans At first Flynns return to New York is marked with some playful criticism for going over budget The auction house is in dispute over the check that he wrote  and his suggestion of using the philosophers stone to pay off the debt is met with resistance since standing policy is that the Library must not profit from its treasures This exasperates the already frustrated Flynn at the duality of his life while he enjoyed the Library initially he has come to resent it now associating each historical treasure with a personal sacrifice made to get it Feeling that his personal life is suffering and his mental health deteriorating none of his friends including Judson  Charlene  and

from the 30 pieces of silver given to Judas Iscariot after he betrayed Jesus Christ Revealing that vampires exist and are evil Judson advises Flynn to intercept the chalice before Sergei Kubichek and his men do In doing so he also gives Flynn crucial tips about killing vampires they have an aversion to silver and if they are staked through the heart it must be with Aspen wood the tree that Judas hanged himself on With renewed purpose Flynn deciphers the clues on the first marker which takes him to the tomb of Marie Laveau the voodoo queen of New Orleans and he discovers the second marker only to be ambushed by Kubicheks men Once taken into custody and revealing that he speaks Russian Kubichek questions Flynn about the marker Flynn refuses to break under interrogation claiming that Kubichek

passengers make for the station waiting room taking out their frustrations on Gander for his lost hat Saul tries to make it clear that You cant stay here but the passengers insist on staying until transport can be arranged Eventually Saul telephones for a bus but for some reason is unable to requisition one He suggests that they walk to the local village but the passengers object upon hearing that it is four miles away In the meantime Gander has rescued his basket from the rain and borrows the ticket office as a changing room In spite of the passengers firm decision to stay put Saul cannot bring himself to leave them alone and neither does he wish to stay with them  his reason being that the station is haunted In 1897 a branch line was run from Fal Vale Junction to an old port crossing the river on a swing bridge at the other end of a tunnel close to the station The swing bridge worked by a wheel on the platform was kept open for china clay boats but was closed whenever trains had to cross it One day some locals chartered a special train to take them home and the then stationmaster Ted Holmes was kept on late night duty to close the bridge for it At eleven oclock he went to close the bridge but he had a heart attack before he could finish doing it He tried to get back to his office and warn Truro about the bridge but his heart failed and he collapsed with his lamp still burning in his hand With Holmes dead and the bridge still open there was no way of preventing a crash Although something warned the train driver Ben Isaacs of the danger he was unable to stop and the train plunged through the open bridge into the river The branch line was supposedly closed afterwards and the bridge has always remained in the open position Ever since that day Saul explains there have been occasions when a train is heard desperately trying to pull up near the station It never arrives anywhere and neither does it start from Truro and it is said to kill anyone who looks upon it If it be a natural thing he asks where do it come fromwhere do it go With that Saul reluctantly leaves the passengers warning them not to look if they hear a train that night Miss Bourne is still shaken after hearing his story but Richard sceptically passes it off as nonsense Gander has been listening in on the story too and makes a great fuss of it in order to take his mind off things Richard starts a game of chess with Dr Sterling Gander tries to liven things up by singing The Seaside Band but this ends prematurely when Richard loses his temper and throws his gramophone out onto the track In a surprisingly calm act of retaliation Gander picks up the chess set and throws it into the fireplace After another few moments Miss Bourne hears something in the station buffet Richard goes to investigate followed by Gander who pretends that someone is trying to murder him but it turns out there is nothing to worry about Gander then notices that Miss Bourne has some tea with her and they decide to make some up for refreshment Teddy sends Gander to fetch some water while he and Jackie prepare to make the tea but the only source turns out to be a water crane on the platform In order to stay dry Gander improvises a raincoat from a tablecloth and a sheet of tarpaulin but while obtaining his supply of water he finds the old bridge wheel Curious as to what might happen he tries to turn it but the wheel is chained and padlocked and he can barely move it He gives up and takes the water into the buffet where he makes mention of the wheel to Teddy and Jackie before teaurning the gas on in a rather flashy fashion Again he tries to start conversation with Jackie but Teddy interferes again and sends him back into the waiting room where he tries in vain to entertain the other passengers with ghost stories Teddy and Jackie soon bring the tea through to the waiting room and the passengers share out what little food they have to make a meal of it During their midnight meal Gander acts as if Ted Holmes ghost is lying in the doorway to the branch line platform repeatedly stumbling as if the ghost had tripped him up In the end he moves the ghost out of harms way and offers to provide a dessert from a chocolate machine outside When he returns however he finds to his disappointment that he has bought several boxes of matches As he is telling a story of an accompanying passenger smoking a cigarette until it burned through his lip  they hear footsteps outside Richard opens the door to the branch line platform and a seriously ill Saul Hodgkin collapses into the room Gander rushes outside with his lamp and raincoat to fill a glass with water from the water crane while Richard Teddy and Dr Sterling carry Saul into the ticket office By the time Gander arrives back Dr Sterling pronounces Saul dead When Edna hears about it she scared to stay at the station with a corpse Edna persuades her reluctant fianc Herbert that they would be better off trying to get back to her mother Teddy tries to call the police but the line appears to be down Miss Bourne is in a dreadful state after she fainted when Saul collapsed into the room so Gander borrows a bottle of brandy from Dr Sterling to soothe her nerves Although a strict temperance teetotaler Miss Bourne drinks the whole lot and becomes noticeably drunk Teddy Jackie and Gander bring her through to the buffet to sleep it off during which Gander tries and fails comically at a trick he had seen at the Hippodrome where all the crockery stays on the table when he pulls the rug off Shortly after Herbert and Edna burst into the waiting room with only half their luggage A knock is heard and they open the door to reveal a terrified young woman in black The stranger pleads for help saying that someone is coming for her but there is something she has to see The passengers are confused particularly when the young woman acts as if they know what she is talking about  until Teddy sees a car coming down the road As they watch the car spins off the road and crashes into a tree so Teddy accompanied by Gander and Dr Sterling go to see what has happened The driver of the car is unhurt but his car is badly damaged It turns out that he had skidded on Herbert and Ednas luggage including a fender donated them by the owner of a furniture shop They return to the waiting room with the battered luggage and the driver of the car who introduces himself as Price and explains that he has come in search of his sister Julia He adds that she suffers from delusions and is normally kept under observation Julia overhears and emerges from the buffet protesting that he is lying Price further explains that she once thought she had seen the ghost train and this was such a shock to her that has retained a fascination for it ever since and experiences compulsions to try and see it again He is curious however as to how they heard about the ghost train the passengers reply that Saul Hodgkin had told them but is lying dead in the ticket office Price goes to take a look but Sauls body has mysteriously vanished and his desk was just the way he had left it earlier When they explain to Price what had happened Julia insinuates that it was actually Ted Holmes Dr Sterling suggests that Julia remains at the station until she realises that the ghost train doesnt exist Price reluctantly concedes but insists before he leaves that Julia comes back with him as soon as he can find a car Some time after he leaves a signal bell is heard to ring in the ticket office followed by the shrieking whistle of an approaching train Teddy and Richard try to open the doors and get a look at the train but the doors wont open As it thunders through the station Julia smashes a window to get a look at the train but faints the moment she sees it Dr Sterling makes her comfortable on one of the waiting room benches and requests for a glass of water Teddy and Gander who suspect trouble take this opportunity to go outside to do some sleuthing The rain has stopped but Gander is surprised to find that Sauls lamp has vanished too Further surprise comes when Teddy finds the bridge has been closed  then they hear singing from the tunnel mouth and look to see someone wandering towards them Julia hears it from the waiting room and claims that Ben Isaacs the sole survivor of the accident is coming back just as he had after the accident  out of his mind and singing Rock of Ages Teddy knows better however and shoots at the ghost causing it to flee back into the tunnel He and Gander run after it but Teddy spots a sheet of cloth with drops of blood on it and heads back to the waiting room Gander doesnt realise Teddys distraction until he is some way into the tunnel Price has managed to requisition a bus but is perplexed to hear from Richard that some idiots been fooling around with a gun outside At that very same moment Teddy reenters the room and holds everyone at gunpoint locking the doors as he does so He shows them the bloodstained cloth and begins to explain about the hoax behind the ghost train someone has taken advantage of the accident and a local superstition to make their job easier except that it didnt work on him and his fellow passengers This ghost train he adds happens to be as real as the Plymouth Express But before he can elaborate on this Jackie points out that Gander was the reason for them being here in the first place Teddy is taken off guard by this allowing Richard to punch him hard in the jaw and knock him out They carry him to the bus with their luggage and are just about to start away when Gander arrives in time to catch it He notices Teddy lying unconscious next to him and tries to bring him round When at last Teddy comes to he is furious with Richard for what he had done for now there will be noone to intercept the train on its return journey Julia insists that the ghost train never comes back but Teddy counters that it is more obliging in that makes a return journey Gander remarks that if it is a ghost train it wont matter if the bridge is open  and points out that that was what he had done a few moments back Dr Sterling suddenly moves towards the front of the bus at this point and orders the driver to stop while Julia and her brother hold everyone at gunpoint He tells the driver that the bridge is open and orders him to turn back so that they can warn the train Meanwhile guns are being loaded aboard the ghost train from a nearby beach As it turns out Saul Hodgkin is very much alive and in the thick of the business He flags the train off and climbs aboard as they start away with their illegal cargo On the bus Teddy explains to Richard that the ghost train is really a gunrunners train being used by Fifth Columnists sympathetic to the Nazi movement with Price as their leader In the distance Julia can see the train on the last curve before the bridge Price and Sterling order the driver to stop and Price heads down the embankment with Julia and the driver to try and stop the train but it pays little heed to them as it hurtles towards the bridge Just as Sterling is trying to retrieve Teddys gun from Richard Gander sounds a buzzer in the drivers cab startling the doctor and enabling Teddy to knock him unconscious Taking Sterlings gun with them the passengers make their escape At the same time the driver of the ghost train realises too late that the bridge is open and applies his brakes But there is nothing he can do to stop in time and the train takes a nosedive from the bridge and crashes into the river Afterwards Teddy discreetly explains to Gander that confidentially he isnt whom he makes himself out to be indicating that he may officially have been sent to investigate the case for British Intelligence Richard admits that he has been rather foolish and apologises to both Teddy and Gander Miss Bourne then staggers out of the buffet with a terrible headache Thankful that as far as she is concerned nothing exciting has happened she makes for the special train they have ordered while Teddy and Gander look on in amusement

permission from her employer Meanwhile a military helicopter drops experimental sonar transmitters into the water causing a pod of whales to go out of control and start ramming a nearby glacier In the chaos the helicopter crashes into the glacier and the combined damage breaks the glacier open thawing two hibernating prehistoric creatures MacNeil narrowly avoids destruction as unknown to her a giant shark and octopus are freed Some time later a drilling platform off the coast of Japan is attacked by the octopus which has tentacles large enough to wrap around the entire structure After returning to Point Dume California MacNeil investigates the corpse of a beached whale covered with bloody wounds Her employer Dick Richie  believes them to be from a tanker propeller but MacNeil insists they appear to be from a creature Later she extracts what appears to be a sharks tooth from one of the wounds Elsewhere the huge shark leaps tens of thousands of feet into the air from the ocean and attacks a commercial aircraft forcing it to crash into the water  A review board convenes and fires MacNeil from the oceanographic institute for stealing the submarine She brings the shark tooth to her old professor former US Navy pilot Lamar Sanders  who believes it belonged to a Megalodon an enormous species of shark believed to have become extinct 15 million years ago The duo is visited by Dr Seiji Shimada  a Japanese scientist trying to determine what attacked the drilling platform The four review a videotape recorded during MacNeils submarine voyage finding images of both the megalodon and a gigantic octopus MacNeil reflects on the polar ice caps melting due to manmade global warming and wonders if the creatures are mankinds comeuppance Meanwhile a US naval destroyer engages the megalodon but is destroyed after its guns fail to destroy the shark MacNeil Sanders and Shimada are arrested by a team of soldiers and taken to government official Allan Baxter  a rude and racist man who demands their help in destroying the creatures The four agree to help in exchange for the government trying to capture the creatures for study rather than destroy them While working at a naval laboratory to develop a method for luring the creatures MacNeil and Shimada become attracted to each other and have sex in a utility closet The incident makes them realize they can attract the creatures using chemicals MacNeil and Sanders agree to place a trap for the shark in San Francisco Bay while Shimada returns to Tokyo to attract the octopus MacNeil and Sanders barely escape the shark after placing the trap with a minisubmarine The plan fails however when the shark destroys another destroyer sent by Baxter The shark then resurfaces and bites off a large portion of the Golden Gate Bridge killing thousands of civilians Later Shimada contacts the Americans and says the Japanese trap only having the same disaster succeeded in angering the octopus which has escaped despite multiple artillery and missile hits Baxter suggests using nuclear weapons against the creatures which MacNeil Sanders and Shimada strongly oppose due to the risk of marine devastation coastal damage and human casualties As an alternative MacNeil suggests using the same pheromone traps to create a Thrilla in Manila by drawing the two creatures together She believes that because the two creatures were frozen in ice locked in combat they must be natural rivals and their aggressiveness towards one another will cause them to fight to the death if theyre lured together MacNeil Sanders and Baxter are assigned to a submarine to find the shark and lure it to the North Pacific Ocean After a short search the submarine brings both the shark and the octopus to an ice trench off the Alaskan coast where MacNeil first encountered the creatures Sanders himself ends up piloting the sub after the original pilot loses his nerve and pulls a gun on the captain  before he is overtaken The octopus and shark begin to fight but they separate and the shark attacks the submarine dragging it in its mouth MacNeil Sanders and Baxter man a rowing boat and detach just as the shark bites the larger submarine in half killing the rest of the crew The shark nearly destroys the rowing boat but they are saved when a Japanese sub manned by Shimada fires torpedoes at it The octopus entangles the Japanese submarine and nearly destroys it but the sub is released after the octopus is attacked by the shark The two creatures engage in a fierce battle at the end of which the octopus strangles the shark after the shark dismembers some of its tentacles causing it to bleed to death The two sink dead still locked from their battle McNeil and the others after watching the showdown between the two monsters discover
